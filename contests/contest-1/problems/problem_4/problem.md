### Problem 3: Valid Palindrome

#### Description:
Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

#### Input:
- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) â€” the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains a string `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 1000) which represents the string for which we need to check if it is a palindrome.

#### Output:
- For each test case, print `YES` if the string is a palindrome and `NO` otherwise.

#### Example:
**Input:**
- 4 A man, a plan, a canal, Panama racecar hello Was it a car or a cat I saw

**Output:**
YES YES NO YES

#### Notes:
- The check should ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
- The output should be case-insensitive (`YES` and `NO`).
