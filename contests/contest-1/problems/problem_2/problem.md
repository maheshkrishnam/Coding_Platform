### Problem 2: Palindrome Number

#### Description:
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

A number is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

#### Input:
- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  1. An integer `x` (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9) representing the number to check.

#### Output:
For each test case, output "Yes" if the number is a palindrome, otherwise output "No".

#### Constraints:
- `-10^9 <= x <= 10^9`
- A number is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
