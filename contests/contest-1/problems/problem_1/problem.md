### Problem 1: Two Sum

#### Description:
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

#### Input:
- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  1. An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^4) - the size of the array `nums`.
  2. A list of `n` integers `nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[n-1]` (1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9).
  3. An integer `target` (1 <= target <= 10^9).

#### Output:
For each test case, output two integers - the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. The indices are 0-based.

#### Constraints:
- The input has exactly one solution.
- All test cases are independent.
