### Problem 4: Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

#### Description:
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### Input:
- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

#### Output:
- For each test case, output the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### Example:
**Input:**
- 3 abcabcbb bbbbb pwwkew

**Output:**
- 3 1 3

#### Notes:
