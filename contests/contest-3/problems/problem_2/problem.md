### Problem 2: Palindrome String Check

#### Description:
Given a string, check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.

#### Input:
- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), which may contain spaces and punctuation.

#### Output:
- For each test case, print `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

#### Example:
**Input:**
- 3 A man, a plan, a canal, Panama racecar hello

**Output:**
- True True False

#### Notes:
- Ignore spaces, punctuation, and case when checking for palindromes.
