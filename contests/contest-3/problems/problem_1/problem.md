### Problem 1: Count Even Numbers

#### Description:
Given an array of integers, count how many numbers in the array are even.

#### Input:
- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the size of the array.
- An array `nums` of `n` integers, where each integer `nums[i]` (-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

#### Output:
- Return the count of even numbers in the array.

#### Example:
**Input:**
- 6 1 2 3 4 5 6

**Output:**
- 3
