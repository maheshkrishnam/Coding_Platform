# Tries (Prefix Tree)

A Trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a single character of the string. It is commonly used for fast retrieval of keys, prefix matching, and autocomplete features.

### Use Cases:
- Autocomplete and spell-checking
- Prefix matching in search engines

### Time Complexity:
- Insertion: O(m) where m is the length of the string
- Search: O(m)
